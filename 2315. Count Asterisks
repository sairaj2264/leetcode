You are given a string s, where every two consecutive vertical bars '|' are grouped into a pair. In other words, the 1st and 2nd '|' make a pair, the 3rd and 4th '|' make a pair, and so forth.

Return the number of '*' in s, excluding the '*' between each pair of '|'.

Note that each '|' will belong to exactly one pair.

class Solution {
public:
    int countAsterisks(string s) {
        int i,pipe=0,count=0;
        for(i=0;i<s.size();i++){
            if(s[i]=='|'){
                pipe++;
            }
            if(pipe%2==1){
                continue;
            }
            if(s[i]=='*'){
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
